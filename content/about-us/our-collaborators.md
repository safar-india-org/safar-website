*Working in the space between Government and civil society allows SAFAR to bring people with complementary strengths together in order to co-produce institutions and mechanisms of social accountability. We believe that the means are as important as the ends and by playing the role of an independent facilitator that brings government and civil society groups together to further a common agenda of social accountability, we hope to contribute to the discipline of social accountability itself, in theory and practice.*
