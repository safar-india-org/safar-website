*SAFAR is a collective of activists, researchers and development practitioners. We work in the space between government and civil society to build and demonstrate practical interventions that deepen democratic governance such as pro-active disclosure of government information, social audits, transparency in decision making, facilitation support in accessing basic entitlements, and grievance redress, and pursue them till they are institutionalized. Through accountability-in-practice, we also want to expand our collective thinking around accountability through research and reflection. SAFAR is based out of the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, Karnataka.*
