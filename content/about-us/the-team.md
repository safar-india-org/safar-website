SAFAR is a collective of activists, researchers, lawyers and development practitioners that works at the interface between the state, law and society to deepen institutions and practices of social accountability and improve access to welfare. We do this by working in the space between government and civil society to build and demonstrate practical interventions that deepen democratic governance such as pro-active disclosure of government information, social audits, transparency in decision making, facilitation support in accessing basic entitlements, and grievance redress, and pursue them till they are institutionalized. Through accountability-in-practice, we also want to expand our collective thinking around accountability through research and reflection. SAFAR is based out of the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, Karnataka.
