	Nikhil is one of the founding members of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) with Aruna Roy and Shankar Singh. Since 1990, he has been a full-time worker of the MKSS, and a part of the organisation’s decision-making collective. In this capacity he has been involved in struggles of the poor for justice, including grass root struggles for land and the payment of minimum wages. He has also been a part of the organisation’s involvement in collective larger campaigns - most notably for the people’s Right to Information (RTI), and the Right to Work (MGNREGA). Both the RTI and NREGA, which passed in 2005, strengthened people’s rights and entitlements. Nikhil Dey is also part of the effort by people’s movements to build institutions of participatory democracy, where, for instance, peoples platforms for public audits are being institutionalised by introducing statutory requirements of social audits and public hearings.
