	Aruna Roy, Nikhil Dey and Shankar Singh are founder members of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) is a grass roots peoples organisation formed in 1990 with its headquarters in Devdungri, Rajasthan. The MKSS works on the concerns of its primary constituents- peasants and workers, but also engages with wider issues of participatory democracy, and democratic struggle. The peoples struggle for access to official documents which was initiated by the MKSS in rural Rajasthan in the mid 90s has grown from a grassroots movement that triggered broad debate, to a successful nationwide demand for the Right to Information Act, a crucial check against arbitrary governance. The platform of village based public hearings or “Jan Sunwais” pioneered by the MKSS in the mid 1990s has now become an institutionalized means of social audit and democratic participation attested by the Government, Judiciary, C&AG, campaigns and movements across the country. The MKSS has also been a strong supporter and an integral part of the movement demanding the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and continue to play a critical role in its oversight. Aruna, Nikhil and Shankar, individually and collectively have been members of numerous committees set up to advise Government on means of institutionalizing transparency and accountability in governance. They are also associated with global advocacy platforms such as the Progressive International, Open Government Partnership, Publish What you Pay etc that work towards strengthening democracy and accountability.
