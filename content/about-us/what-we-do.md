# Tab 1: Accountability and digital technology

Digital technology is far from neutral. It is embedded in and continually generates structures of power that disproportionately impact the most vulnerable groups. While the scope to expand public accountability through digital technology is vast, accessibility is still an urgent issue. Our work is concerned with how to integrate and ground digital technology in the lived realities of those for whom it is most out of reach.

SARU has collaborated with the Soochna Evum Rozgar Adhikar Abhiyan (SR Abhiyan) and the Department of Information Technology (DoIT), Government of Rajasthan to develop the Jan Soochna Portal. As a single web platform, the Portal offers information related to planning, budgeting, and expenditure of more than 58 schemes across 32 departments. The platform is the first such portal in the country and is a breakthrough for enforcing the disclosure of information under the Right to Information Act. The Portal has been developed and is run by the State DoIT and is the outcome of collaboration between Civil Society Organizations and the Government. which included bi-monthly digital dialogues on discussions on  formats detailing the exact nature of information that is required to be made public, and in what form, for each scheme.

SARU is working with organizations promoting the use of RTI in the State and the Centre for E-Governance, Government of Karnataka to develop a single web platform that provides mandatory disclosure of information, modelled on the Jan Soochna Portal. Karnataka has now become the second state in the country to have a portal like Jan Soochna, known as Mahiti Kanaja, which shared information from the departments of Revenue, Panchayati Raj, Education, Public Distribution System, Social Security Pension, Housing, Agriculture, MGNREGA, Swacch Bharat Mission, Rural Banking, Police, Electricity, Health, and Family Services.

### [Title]  

SARU is working with the Tribal Development Department (TDD), Government of Maharashtra to also build a platform for disclosing actionable and relevant information on interventions rolled out by the TDD. These include: running residential schools in tribal areas, scholarships for tribal students, Forest Rights Act registration, ST Sub Plan, Tribal Health and Nutrition Programmes, infrastructure development in tribal areas, etc. The portal, once developed and launched, will bring actionable information into the public domain.

Governments at various levels have undertaken initiatives to build digital architectures for grievance redress through helplines, web portals, and other extensions. However, this digital architecture often disempowers complainants instead of empowering them. We are working with the SR Abhiyan, Department of Administrative Reforms, Government of Rajasthan, and Tribal Development Department, Government of Maharasthra to develop policies that will facilitate complainants in registering grievances and tracking the status of their redress, and ensuring that public participation guides such processes.

# Tab 2: Strengthening participatory democracy

The concept of social audit received nationwide acceptance with its inclusion in the MGNREG Act. Efforts have been made to build an institutional architecture to conduct social audits in a systematic manner on the basis of minimum norms. This architecture has advanced possibilities of extending it to other programmes. Parliament and Government through legislations and executive orders, respectively, have mandated social audits of the implementation of National Food Security Act, Persons with Disabilities Act, National Social Assistance Programme, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Swacch Bharat Mission, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan etc. The Supreme Court’s directions to conduct social audits in the implementation of Building and other Construction Workers (BoCW) Act and the Juvenile Justice Act has also helped to push the cause of social audits. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India developing Auditing Standards of Social Audit to lay down the minimum standards of the social audit process has also enabled the infusion of norms of independence, credibility and quality in social audits being attempted in different States and schemes. 

SARU has been involved in the conduct of Social Audits of National Food Security Act in collaboration with Department of Food and Civil Supplies, Government of Kerala; Tata Institute for Social Sciences and the State’s Social Audit Unit. The audit was conducted in a low-income residential area in Trivandrum city in Kerala. The audit was able to identify and highlight limitations of digital transparency, emphasizing the need for ongoing citizen education regarding rights and entitlements that is a pre-requisite if the advantages of digital transparency is to be made accessible to the ordinary citizen. A Toolkit/Primer for conduct of Social Audit of NFSA was prepared, and the positive outcomes of the pilot has led to a government decision to carry out social audits in all districts of the state through the State Social Audit Unit.

SARU helped facilitate a pilot social audit of the Destitute Free Kerala Programme of the Govt of Kerala, in collaboration with the Kerala State Social Audit Unit. The Programme is implemented by the State’s Kudambashree network and endeavours to identify “destitute” families through participatory processes and plan projects with the help of local self governments to assist such families. This was the first ever social audit conducted since the inception of this programme in 2004. Based on the successful conclusion of the pilot audit, the State Government has ordered audits to be conducted in other parts of the State too.

The Supreme Court in 2019 gave directions to conduct social audits of the Building and other Construction Workers (BoCW) Act, in order to identify limitations in the implementation of the Act that prevented the rightful beneficiaries i.e. construction workers in rural and urban areas, to access social security from the construction cess collected under the Act. SARU worked with civil society organizations and unions such as National Campaign Committee for Central Legislation for Construction Labour (NCC-CL), Aajeevika Bureau, SR Abhiyan, Aasthan Sansthan, Centre for Advocacy and Research, Gramin Samaj Vikas Sansthan (GSVS), Kotada Adivasi Sangthan, Rajasthan Nirman Evum General Mazdoor Union,  in collaboration with the State and Central Governments to pilot social audits of BoCW in Delhi and Rajasthan. The social audits led to uncovering of serious inadequacies in the implementation of the Act such as instances of workers having to pay bribes to get registered as construction workers under the Act; middlemen and E-Mitra operators siphoning off financial benefits accrued to BoCW registered beneficiaries from various schemes; lack of any information with workers about status of their applications; nexus between labour department officials and common service centres registering workers; institutionalized corruption, exclusion of eligible beneficiaries. Upon the successful completion of the audits, a host of corrective measures were set off including cancelling the licences of 45 common service centres, FIRs being filed against those who took bribes from workers and organization of daily camps to register eligible construction workers in the area. Based on the methodology followed in the pilot Social Audit, the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India issued directions to all State Governments to conduct social audits as per the protocol followed in the audit.

Meghalaya is the country’s first State to enact a law that mandates social audits across more than 21 schemes and 11 Line Departments in the State. The Law enables citizens participation in the planning of development, selection of beneficiaries, concurrent monitoring of programmes, the redress of grievances, and audit of works, services, and programmes on an annual basis. In a 6th schedule area like Meghalaya, it potentially provides democratic tribal communities an opportunity to use their traditional strength of community decision making to shape the nature and implementation of development programmes. SARU has collaborated with the State Government and civil society organizations such as Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS), Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Initiatives (SATHI), Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF), National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR), Jan Jagran Shakti Sangathan (JJSS), Population Foundation of India (PFI), Social Audit Unit of Jharkhand and Telengana State and others to conduct pilot social audits; steer trainings and capacity building programmes for social audit resource persons; drafting of rules to guide the implementation of the Law in future; preparation of formats for audit verification and reporting; helping in the institutionalization of the implementation machinery required to be put in place through the law. Engagement with social audits in Meghalaya taught us about how social audits as a process can be re-envisioned to apply to multiple contexts simultaneously and offer itself as a platform for both citizen audit and grievance redress.

In the spirit of trying to embed social audits in emerging areas of relevance, we are attempting to conduct pilot social audits of the District Mineral Foundation Trust (Chhattisgarh), Forest Rights Act (Rajasthan) and Tribal Health Cooperatives (Kerala). Watch this space for more! 

SARU is working with Environics Trust and other campaigns to advocate for and strengthen transparency in the operations of the extractives industry. SARU, in collaboration with other peoples campaigns and networks working in mining affected areas together developed a India Extractives Transparency Charter to lay down minimum principles of transparency and information sharing that should govern the operations of the extractive industry. We continue to work with the member campaigns and seek opportunities to enforce the Charter as and when opportunities arise

# Tab 3: State-citizen interfaces

Through our work, we have tried to build platforms of dialogue between civil society organizations, government authorities and IT service providers to move from “Management Information Systems” towards “Janta Information Systems”, where citizens have a role in deciding what information should be collected, how it should be stored, how it should be disclosed, and how it should be used. The dialogues known as ‘Digital Dialogues’ is an attempt to bring grassroots activists, IT professionals and representatives of Line Departments together to discuss what information should be disclosed in the public domain through a web portal, and in what format, so that citizens individually and collectively can use information to better access their entitlements and hold local implementation more accountable to its mandate. The Digital Dialogue is a non-funded initiative where the State Government physically hosts the dialogue and funds required for travel of participating activists are crowd funded on a case by case basis.

As part of an attempt to engage with institutional platforms in the landscape of urban governance, for strengthening social accountability, SARU has been trying to work for better implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment (CA) or Nagarapalika Act and the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, which mandate the constitution of Ward Committees at ward level and Area Sabhas at sub-ward level in the 11 municipal corporations spread across Karnataka to devolve “Power to the People”. SARU in collaboration with Citizens’ Voluntary Initiative for the City of Bangalore (CIVIC) has been working towards conducting training and sensitization workshops with CSOs, citizen networks, colleges on the provisions of the 74th Amendment and the platforms and mechanisms available to citizens to ensure decision making by Ward Committees and Area Sabhas in several wards of Bengaluru and many municipal corporations of Karnataka and ensure Municipal Corporations are transparent and accountable to the communities they are intended to serve. Inputs are also being gathered to suggest amendments to the KMC Act to strengthen the provisions regarding citizen participation.

The registration of Building and other Construction Workers (BOCWs) was seen as a priority area in Meghalaya. To facilitate this, awareness is one initiative that was undertaken. Efforts were made by SARU to bring together various Unions working in the State to provide assistance to construction workers to register, and then support them in tracking their registration with the concerned Department.

# Tab 4: Law and Policy 

While our work emphasizes on unpacking elements of social accountability in varying fields and contexts, so that its scope and reach both widen, it also includes efforts to have mechanisms that sustain such elements, institutionalized within the State. 

SARU is currently working with civil society organizations such as Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), National Institute for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR) and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India to prepare a Social Accountability Policy and scheme specific guidelines which will enable grounding elements of social accountability, in practice. This includes incorporating specific components of accountability which include provisions for mandatory disclosure of information, grievance redress, social audits, community monitoring and participatory planning in six schemes of the Ministry – SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, Scholarship Assistance for SC, OBC and EBC students, Development Action Plan for SCs, Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana, National Action Plan for Senior Citizens and interventions for drug and substance abuse. 

SARU is supporting civil society groups and campaigns in Rajasthan such as Soochna Evum Rozgar Adhikar Abhiyan (SR Abhiyan) with the advocacy for a Social Accountability Bill in the State. The Bill provides for a legal framework for disclosure of information, registration of grievances and their redress within a time period, citizens’ right to being heard in a public collective platform at the Block level every fortnight, an independent appellate mechanism for grievance redress, setting up of information and facilitation centres and social audits. The Bill builds upon the ‘Right of Citizens for Time bound Delivery of Goods and Services and redressal of their grievances Bill, 2011” which was discussed in the Lok Sabha and endorsed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee. SARU has supported the campaign so by developing briefing notes, discussion papers and developing a evidence based justification for the need for such a law. SARU is also extending assistance  to members of a Committee constituted by Government of Rajasthan to come up with a draft Public Accountability Bill, passage of which was committed to by the Government of Rajasthan in its Budget Address in 2019. SARU is also involved with the follow up of a similar legislation being passed in the States of Kerala and Karnataka, based on commitments made by the respective State Governments publicly

Based on pilot social audits of the Meghalaya Community Participation and Public Services Social Audit Act that SARU helped facilitate in Meghalaya, in collaboration with the State Government and civil society organizations, rules were formulated to guide the scale up of social audits across the States. Rules under the Act have been notified and form the basis of social audits in the State.

Based on the pilot social audits conducted in Delhi and Rajasthan of the Building and other Construction Workers Act, submissions were made to the Central Government on model rules that should govern this process in the future. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has issued instructions to all State Governments to conduct social audits of BoCW, based on the protocol that was arrived at through the pilots.

The Digital Dialogues between Government of Rajasthan and Soochna Evum Rozgar Adhikar Abhiyan (SR Abhiyan) enabled a platform through with civil society organizations have a role in deciding what information should be collected, how it should be stored, how it should be disclosed, and how it should be used. The Dialogues have now led Guidelines developed to govern the development of Jan Soochna Portal. The guidelines lay down norms for the nature of information that all Line Departments, Public Sector Units, Public Sector Corporations and Government Autonomous Bodies ought to publicly disclose under Section 4(2) of the RTI Act; the duties of the Line Departments to digitize and disclose information, reduce "password based administrative logins that prevent information disclosure" and use existing databases to automatically
identify eligible beneficiaries for schemes and an institutionalized mechanism for civil society, elected representatives and Government to together monitor and guide the
building and operationalization of the Jan Soochna Portal

# Tab 5: Practice to theory, theory to practice 

While the modes and methods of social accountability have considerably expanded in the last few years, it is an open question whether political accountability is shrinking? While the idea and parameters of democracy itself is being redefined under the present regime, what is the relationship between accountability and democracy? How does one shape the other? And importantly, how do these fit within the framework of the Indian Constitution. There is a need to incorporate the practice and deliberations around social accountability in India, into academic curricula that deal with citizen-state relationships, thereby enabling students to engage with this framework, both theoretically and practically, and thereby contribute to
the growing body of knowledge. It is in this context, that SARU in collaboration with National Law School of India University (NLSIU) aims to offer a two-credit course (30 hours) on Social Accountability for students of law and public policy at NLSIU.

Team members of SARU have written papers that can be accessed here
