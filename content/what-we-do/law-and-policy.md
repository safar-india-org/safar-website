While our work emphasizes on unpacking elements of social accountability in varying fields and contexts, so that its scope and reach both widen, it also includes efforts to have mechanisms that sustain such elements, institutionalized within the State. 

SARU is currently working with civil society organizations such as Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR), National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), National Institute for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRDPR) and the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India to prepare a Social Accountability Policy and scheme specific guidelines which will enable grounding elements of social accountability, in practice. This includes incorporating specific components of accountability which include provisions for mandatory disclosure of information, grievance redress, social audits, community monitoring and participatory planning in six schemes of the Ministry – SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, Scholarship Assistance for SC, OBC and EBC students, Development Action Plan for SCs, Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana, National Action Plan for Senior Citizens and interventions for drug and substance abuse. 

SARU is supporting civil society groups and campaigns in Rajasthan such as Soochna Evum Rozgar Adhikar Abhiyan (SR Abhiyan) with the advocacy for a Social Accountability Bill in the State. The Bill provides for a legal framework for disclosure of information, registration of grievances and their redress within a time period, citizens’ right to being heard in a public collective platform at the Block level every fortnight, an independent appellate mechanism for grievance redress, setting up of information and facilitation centres and social audits. The Bill builds upon the ‘Right of Citizens for Time bound Delivery of Goods and Services and redressal of their grievances Bill, 2011” which was discussed in the Lok Sabha and endorsed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee. SARU has supported the campaign so by developing briefing notes, discussion papers and developing a evidence based justification for the need for such a law. SARU is also extending assistance  to members of a Committee constituted by Government of Rajasthan to come up with a draft Public Accountability Bill, passage of which was committed to by the Government of Rajasthan in its Budget Address in 2019. SARU is also involved with the follow up of a similar legislation being passed in the States of Kerala and Karnataka, based on commitments made by the respective State Governments publicly
