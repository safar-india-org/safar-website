###Consultations for building a framework for an Urban Employment Guarantee

The COVID-19 lockdown has exposed the fault lines of our welfare architecture like never before. The flight of migrant workers from our cities once the lockdown was announced in March 2020 revealed just how precarious the situation of urban workers in our cities is. This moments calls for a renewed discussion on long term social security and a right to work for the urban working class. SAFAR along with the Peoples’ Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) and the Centre for Sustainable Employment (CSE) at Azim Premji University has initiated a series of consultations to seek views of social movements, unions, campaigns, networks, organizations, researchers and industry to develop a draft protective framework for urban workers. This framework will contain the minimum elements of what should constitute an urban employment guarantee. 

The Peoples’ Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) formed in 2004, is a loose coalition of peoples’ organizations, activists, media professionals, lawyers and academics which successfully campaigned for the need for an employment guarantee act. Subsequent to the passage of the MGNREGA, it now attempts to play the role of a coalition exercising oversight on the implementation of the Act with the primary objective of protecting workers’ entitlements.
