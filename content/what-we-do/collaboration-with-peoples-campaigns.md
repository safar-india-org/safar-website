#### Consultations on a National Urban Employment Guarantee Law

The COVID-19 lockdown has exposed the fault lines of our welfare architecture like never before. The flight of migrant workers from our cities once the lockdown was announced in March 2020 revealed just how precarious the situation of urban workers in our cities is. This moment calls for a renewed discussion on long term social security and a right to work for the urban working class. SAFAR along with the Peoples’ Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) and the Centre for Sustainable Employment (CSE) at Azim Premji University has initiated a series of consultations to seek views of social movements, unions, campaigns, networks, organizations, researchers and industry to develop a draft protective framework for urban workers. This framework will contain the minimum elements of what should constitute an urban employment guarantee. More details on this public campaign can be found here

The Peoples’ Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) formed in 2004, is a loose coalition of peoples’ organizations, activists, media professionals, lawyers and academics which successfully campaigned for the need for an employment guarantee act. Subsequent to the passage of the MGNREGA, it now attempts to play the role of a coalition exercising oversight on the implementation of the Act with the primary objective of protecting workers’ entitlements.

#### National Workshop on Social Audits

SAFAR along with other organizations and campaigns organized a 3 day national seminar and workshop on ‘Social Audits in India Today and An Agenda for Action’, from 5-7th November 2020. Social audits as a means of democratic governance in India, has grown from strength to strength over the past two decades. The institutionalization of social audits has deepened and its breadth and depth has expanded in creative ways. However, like democracy, social audits in India today are also facing multiple challenges. The workshop brought together more than 40 discussants from civil society, peoples' campaigns, judiciary, government, audit institutions, social audit units and academia to engage with questions such as: what is the state of government and civil society oversight today? What are the key entitlements that should be tracked across sectors? How can public audits be strengthened?

The discussions over three days provided a much-needed opportunity to reflect on the challenges and opportunities for social audits in India and forge a practical agenda for collaborative action to extend social audits in new areas such as law enforcement, environment regulation, social justice, health and education amongst others.

#### Monitoring NREGA implementation

SAFAR, as part of the Peoples’ Action for Employment Guarantee, has helped put together periodic trackers on NREGA implementation and legal interventions on protecting workers’ entitlement under the law.

The Peoples’ Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) formed in 2004, is a loose coalition of peoples’ organizations, activists, media professionals, lawyers and academics which successfully campaigned for the need for an employment guarantee act. Subsequent to the passage of the MGNREGA, it now attempts to play the role of a coalition exercising oversight on the implementation of the Act with the primary objective of protecting workers’ entitlements.
