While the modes and methods of social accountability have considerably expanded in the last few years, it is an open question whether political accountability is shrinking? While the idea and parameters of democracy itself is being redefined under the present regime, what is the relationship between accountability and democracy? How does one shape the other? And importantly, how do these fit within the framework of the Indian Constitution. There is a need to incorporate the practice and deliberations around social accountability in India, into academic curricula that deal with citizen-state relationships, thereby enabling students to engage with this framework, both theoretically and practically, and thereby contribute to
the growing body of knowledge. It is in this context, that SARU in collaboration with National Law School of India University (NLSIU) aims to offer a two-credit course (30 hours) on Social Accountability for students of law and public policy at NLSIU.
