*While the modes and methods of social accountability have expanded considerably in the last few years, the question remains: is political accountability shrinking? While the parameters of democracy are being redefined under the present regime, what is the relationship between accountability and democracy? How do these fit within the framework of the Indian Constitution? We debate these questions and more as we move from practice to theory and theory to practice.*

#### 12 Week Course on Social Accountability, National Law School, Benguluru

SAFAR offers a two-credit course (40 hours) on Social Accountability for students of law and public policy at the Institute of Public Policy, National Law School, Benguluru. The course explores a range of substantive debates around welfare rights and social accountability. The course is rooted in theory that has emerged from practice. It introduces students to the experiences and challenges ordinary people face as they make claims of the state and seek access to basic rights. 
The course was first taught as an elective in 2020 and then as a compulsory course in 2021. The course blends theory and practice with a host of guest lecturers by practitioners, activists, bureaucrats, frontline functionaries and researchers who share insights from their work with students and help deepen our collective understanding of social accountability.
