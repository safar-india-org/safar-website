Through our work, we have tried to build platforms of dialogue between civil society organizations, government authorities and IT service providers to move from “Management Information Systems” towards “Janta Information Systems”, where citizens have a role in deciding what information should be collected, how it should be stored, how it should be disclosed, and how it should be used. The dialogues known as ‘Digital Dialogues’ is an attempt to bring grassroots activists, IT professionals and representatives of Line Departments together to discuss what information should be disclosed in the public domain through a web portal, and in what format, so that citizens individually and collectively can use information to better access their entitlements and hold local implementation more accountable to its mandate. The Digital Dialogue is a non-funded initiative where the State Government physically hosts the dialogue and funds required for travel of participating activists are crowd funded on a case by case basis.

As part of an attempt to engage with institutional platforms in the landscape of urban governance, for strengthening social accountability, SARU has been trying to work for better implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment (CA) or Nagarapalika Act and the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, which mandate the constitution of Ward Committees at ward level and Area Sabhas at sub-ward level in the 11 municipal corporations spread across Karnataka to devolve “Power to the People”. SARU in collaboration with Citizens’ Voluntary Initiative for the City of Bangalore (CIVIC) has been working towards conducting training and sensitization workshops with CSOs, citizen networks, colleges on the provisions of the 74th Amendment and the platforms and mechanisms available to citizens to ensure decision making by Ward Committees and Area Sabhas in several wards of Bengaluru and many municipal corporations of Karnataka and ensure Municipal Corporations are transparent and accountable to the communities they are intended to serve. Inputs are also being gathered to suggest amendments to the KMC Act to strengthen the provisions regarding citizen participation.

The registration of Building and other Construction Workers (BOCWs) was seen as a priority area in Meghalaya. To facilitate this, awareness is one initiative that was undertaken. Efforts were made by SARU to bring together various Unions working in the State to provide assistance to construction workers to register, and then support them in tracking their registration with the concerned Department.
