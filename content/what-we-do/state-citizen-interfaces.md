SAFAR builds platforms for dialogue between civil society organizations, government authorities, and IT service providers to move from opaque “Management Information Systems” towards open “Janta Information Systems.” These open systems give citizens a role in deciding what information should be collected and how it should be stored, disclosed, and used. 

### Digital Dialogues, Rajasthan 

In an ongoing series called Digital Dialogues, SAFAR brings together grassroots activists, IT professionals, and government departments to discuss how information is shared and made accessible to citizens in the public domain.

### Strengthening Ward Committees, Karnataka

To strengthen accountability in urban governance, SAFAR works on implementing the Nagarapalika and Karnataka Municipal Corporations acts, which decentralise power to Ward and Area Sabhas. Collaborating with the Citizens’ Voluntary Initiative for the City of Bangalore (CIVIC), SAFAR conducts workshops to improve decision making by Ward Committees and Area Sabhas in select wards across Bengaluru and municipal corporations of Karnataka. We are also providing inputs to amend the KMC Act to strengthen provisions for citizen participation.

SAFAR in collaboration with CIVIC is also involved towards enabling the working of Ward Disaster Management Cells in Bengaluru City, as mandated by the Karnataka High Court (WP No. 6435 of 2020).
